I developed a predictive analytics model aimed at analyzing and forecasting crime rates across various urban areas. This project utilizes socioeconomic data, including factors such as income levels, population density, education, and historical crime statistics, to identify trends and patterns related to criminal activity. By implementing advanced machine learning algorithms, I was able to create a model that not only predicts potential crime hotspots but also provides insights into the underlying factors contributing to crime rates. The model processes large datasets to uncover correlations, enabling law enforcement agencies and policymakers to allocate resources more effectively and implement preventive measures.
